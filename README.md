# Customer Segmentation using K-Means Clustering

## Project Overview

This project involves using K-Means Clustering to group retail store customers based on their purchase history. The goal is to analyze customer data and identify distinct segments to enhance targeted marketing strategies and personalize customer experiences. This project was completed as part of an internship at Prodigy InfoTech.

## Features

- **Customer Purchase History**: Includes data on purchase frequency, amount spent, and types of products bought.
- **Clustering Output**: Segments customers into distinct groups based on their buying behavior.

## Technologies Used

- **Python**: The programming language used for developing the clustering model.
- **Pandas**: For data manipulation and analysis.
- **NumPy**: For numerical computations.
- **Matplotlib/Seaborn**: For data visualization.
- **Scikit-Learn**: For implementing the K-Means Clustering algorithm.

## Installation

1. Clone the repository:
    ```bash
    git clone https://github.com/your-username/customer-segmentation-kmeans.git
    cd customer-segmentation-kmeans
    ```

2. Install the required dependencies:
    ```bash
    pip install -r requirements.txt
    ```

## Usage

1. **Data Preparation**:
    - Load the customer purchase history dataset using Pandas.
    - Perform data cleaning and preprocessing.

2. **Clustering Analysis**:
    - Determine the optimal number of clusters using methods like the Elbow Method.
    - Apply K-Means Clustering to group customers based on their purchase history.
    - Analyze the resulting clusters to identify distinct customer segments.

3. **Visualization**:
    - Visualize the clusters to understand the distribution of customers in different segments.

## Data Preprocessing

- **Data Cleaning**: Handled missing values, removed outliers, and ensured consistency in the dataset.
- **Feature Scaling**: Applied normalization or standardization to ensure that features contribute equally to the clustering process.

## Clustering Analysis

- **K-Means Algorithm**: Implemented K-Means Clustering to segment customers into distinct groups.
- **Optimal Clusters**: Used the Elbow Method or Silhouette Score to determine the ideal number of clusters.

## Results

- **Cluster Analysis**: Identified and analyzed distinct customer segments based on purchasing behavior.
- **Insights**: Provided insights into customer buying patterns and how businesses can target these segments for improved marketing strategies.

## Conclusion

This project enhanced my understanding of unsupervised learning and clustering algorithms. The ability to segment customers based on their purchase history can significantly improve targeted marketing and personalization strategies.

## Future Work

- **Cluster Profiling**: Develop detailed profiles for each customer segment to tailor marketing strategies more effectively.
- **Additional Features**: Incorporate additional data features such as customer demographics for more granular segmentation.
- **Real-Time Analysis**: Implement real-time customer segmentation and integration with marketing platforms.
